# TASK-04 Simple Keylogger
- Here we have to create a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. We have to focus on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file.
- **Note: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers.**
- For this we need to install **pynput** library in Python.
- Please find the python program **simple_keylogger.py** attached.

# Keylogger
A keylogger is a type of software or hardware device designed to monitor and record keystrokes on a keyboard. Keyloggers are often used for various purposes, some of which are legitimate and others which are malicious.

**Types of Keyloggers**

1. **Software Keyloggers**:
    - These are programs installed on a computer or mobile device.
    - They can operate at various levels, such as user space or kernel space, depending on their sophistication.
    - They capture keystrokes and store them in a file or send them to a remote server.

2. **Hardware Keyloggers**:
    - These are physical devices that are connected between a keyboard and a computer.
    - They are often small and can be easily hidden.
    - They record keystrokes directly from the keyboard before they reach the computer.

**How Keyloggers Work**

- **Keystroke Logging**: Keyloggers record each key press made by the user. This data can include everything from login credentials to personal messages.
  
- **Data Storage and Transmission**: The captured keystrokes are either stored locally in a file or transmitted to a remote location for analysis.

- **Stealth Operation**: Advanced keyloggers can operate invisibly, making them difficult to detect by the user or antivirus software.

**Uses of Keyloggers**

1. **Legitimate Uses**:
    - **Parental Monitoring**: Parents may use keyloggers to monitor their children's online activities.
    - **Employee Monitoring**: Employers may use keyloggers to monitor employee activities for security and productivity reasons, provided they comply with privacy laws.
    - **Self-Monitoring**: Users may use keyloggers to monitor their own activity, such as for productivity tracking or recovering lost data.

2. **Malicious Uses**:
    - **Cybercrime**: Hackers use keyloggers to steal sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data.
    - **Espionage**: Keyloggers can be used for corporate or governmental espionage to steal confidential information.

**Ethical and Legal Considerations**

- **Consent**: Using a keylogger without the explicit consent of the person being monitored is illegal in many jurisdictions. Consent is crucial to ensure ethical use.
  
- **Privacy Laws**: Keyloggers must comply with privacy laws that protect individuals' rights to privacy and data security. Unauthorized use can lead to severe legal consequences.
